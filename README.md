# Paste Your Screens (pasteurscreens)

Paste Your Screens’ was an idea I had a few years ago—a website where users could upload screenshots. 
Unfortunately, the project was never finished, and I didn’t have the skills at the time to develop the necessary software to complete it.

Now, I’m excited to say that ‘Paste Your Screens’ is back, reborn as a new, fully finished project called [ScreenMe](https://screen-me.cloud).
You can find the new repository code of the software right here : [Repository](https://github.com/Sorok-Dva/ScreenMe)
